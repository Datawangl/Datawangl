- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Datawangl

Transitioning from years of exploratory academic research, I have a keen insight in conducting hypothesis testing and data analysis in broader fields interested. I am looking for working with Data, with good statistical knowledge and the ability to identify fine points of data. Well-versed in data visualization, exploratory & inferential data analysis techniques, predictive models using machine learning algorithms (supervised and unsupervised). An excellent team player for timely delivery of authentic results and reports.
